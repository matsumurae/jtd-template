A simple-to-use, clean and customized theme made using [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme!

## Benefits of this theme

1. Multilanguage search.
2. i18n support.
3. Custom styles made for transcribing podcasts, to diferentiate between speakers. Check them [here]({% link docs/ui-components/alerts.md %}).
4. Full screen template versus Just the Docs originally condensed.
5. Dashboard-inspired. You have a true mobile experience!
