A simple-to-use, clean and customized theme made using [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme!

## Benefits of this template

### Ready to go

Just need one click [here](https://github.com/matsumurae/jtd-template/generate) and you'll be redirected to use this template as a template for your site. That's all! No more, no less.

### Multilanguage search supported

You just need to add the desired languages to `assets/js/vendor` with the ones you want. Check out [lunr-languages](https://github.com/MihaiValentin/lunr-languages/tree/b16c6e748eec80687d65a8a9deec336128bbb9d7).

**Right now you have `en`, `es` and `jp`.**

### Podcast-made

Yes! This was made with podcasts transcription in mindâ€¦ Say, you have a transcript with multiple speakers. How do you diferentiate them? Check [here]({% link docs/ui-components/alerts.md %}).

### Dashboard inspired

Compared to Just the Docs (which has a max size window), you have a full screen complete mobile experience.
